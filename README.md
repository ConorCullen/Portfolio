# Portfolio

A portfolio of some of my group projects that I've done at University, including Python programming for Machine Learning and Mathematical Data Modelling.

## Bayesian Linear Regression, Gaussian Process Regression and Principle Component Analysis

A third year machine learning group project which I worked on with Mike Talbot.  We achieved a First Class grade with a mark of 75% in this coursework.  I highly enjoyed this project as I learnt a lot about the key components of machine learning, including statistics and calculus.

This project challenged us to interpret different aspects of building models of data, in particular Bayesian linear regression and non-parametric models, as well as learning the theory behind them.  This includes a 10 page report detailing our conclusions, the project brief and the code we used to tackle the problems.
