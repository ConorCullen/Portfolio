# Portfolio

A portfolio of some of my group projects that I've done at University, including Python programming for Machine Learning and Mathematical Data Modelling.

## Bayesian Linear Regression, Gaussian Process Regression and Principle Component Analysis

A third year machine learning group project which I worked on with Mike Talbot.  We achieved a First Class grade with a mark of 75% in this coursework.  I highly enjoyed this project as I learnt a lot about the key components of machine learning, including statistics and calculus.

This project challenged us to interpret different aspects of building models of data, in particular Bayesian linear regression and non-parametric models, as well as learning the theory behind them.  This includes a 10 page report detailing our conclusions, the project brief and the code we used to tackle the problems.

## Emergence of Segregation in Networks

A second year mathematical modelling group project based on different types of networks and measuring segregation through Markov chain convergence.  The project mark given was a First Class at 75% but I achieved a mark of 86% for my significant contributions.  The code made for the mathematical model is included in both the appendix of the report and separate files.
