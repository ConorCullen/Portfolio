# Portfolio

A portfolio of some of my group projects that I've done at University, including Python programming for Machine Learning and Mathematical Data Modelling.

## Bayesian Linear Regression, Gaussian Process Regression and Principle Component Analysis

A third year machine learning group project which I worked on with Mike Talbot (@miketalbotbox).  We achieved a First Class grade with a mark of 75% in this coursework.  I highly enjoyed this project as I learnt a lot about the key components of machine learning, including statistics and calculus.

This project challenged us to interpret different aspects of building models of data, in particular Bayesian linear regression and non-parametric models, as well as learning the theory behind them.  This includes a 9 page report detailing our conclusions, the project brief and the code we made to tackle the problems.

## Image De-noising and Segmentation Using Iterative Conditional Modes, Gibbs Sampling and Mean Field Variational Bayes in The Ising Model

Another third year machine learning group project which I worked on with Mike Talbot (@miketalbotbox).  We achieved a First Class grade with a mark of 87% in this coursework.  This was more applied than the previous project and looked at some very practical uses of machine learning.

The aim of the project was to remove the noise from a corrupted image.  In the Ising Model, we model each observed pixel as generated by latent pixels lying in a Markov Random Field.  We use methods like Gibbs Sampling and Mean Field Variational Bayes to recover the image, and compared the accuracy of the image.

The second part of the project was to use image segmentation to segment an image into its corresponding foreground and background layers.  This was done by using K-means clustering to separate different colours and plotting histograms which show where their probability density in the image.  The project includes a 5 page report detailing our conclusions, the project brief and the code we made to tackle the problems.

## Emergence of Segregation in Networks

A second year mathematical modelling group project based on different types of networks and measuring segregation through Markov chain convergence.  The project mark given was a First Class at 75% but I achieved a mark of 86% for my significant contributions.  The code made for the mathematical model is included in both the appendix of the report and separate files.
